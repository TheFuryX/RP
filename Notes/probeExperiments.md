**Sputnik 1**

###Science Experiments

- Barometer (It seems as if the atmosphere extends further than you thought)
- Electron density measurements (The electrons in the ionosphere affect your ability to communicate with the probe)
- Temperature (Space is really cold!)

###Cost

$?

**Sputnik 2**

###Science Experiments

- Spectrophotometer (The sun appears to be emitting both UV light and X-rays)
- Geiger Counter (The probe notices some unusual concentrations of radiation, but the data is misplaced)
- Live Mammal (Observations show that temperature control is important to extended crewed missions)
- Temperature (The sun heats the spacecraft very quickly)
- Barometer (Despite getting thinner, the atmosphere does not appear to end at this altitude)

###Cost

**Sputnik 3**

###Science Experiments

- Barometer
- Spectrophotometer (The cosmic rays seem to contain unusually heavy nuclei)
- Magnetometer 
- Electrostatic
- Geiger Counter (The probe seems to have found radiation belts, but the tape breaks)
